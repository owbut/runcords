Runcords
========

Runcords saves and archives all paddles from each NYC and MTABC depot
into a compressed zip file corresponding to the pick code.

Notice
------
Project is abandoned.

Limitations
-----------

Because of the limitations with the source, in order to save other
scheduled days, you will have to wait for that schedule to be active.

For example, if you run the tool on a day when the school is in session,
it will only save the OPEN paddles.

WARNING: The passphrase is stored locally within .runcords_config.json.
If you are going to distribute the program, please redirect them to this
repository. Thank you :-)
